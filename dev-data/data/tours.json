    "summary": "Not many people consider trekking to Upper Mustang because there is not enough awareness around it. So, let me help you. If you are after miles and miles of wilderness far away from the more inhabited world, this is one of the best places to visit in Nepal. This remote Himalayan region is a rare privilege due to its long, rich, and complex history. It is a perfect combo of culture, history, and trekking. You can also expect to experience a true mountain way of life, and locals who for hundreds of years, had very little contact with the outside world. In fact, Upper Mustang was a restricted demilitarized area until 1992, which makes it one of the most preserved regions in the world due to its relative isolation from the outside world. Let the Himalaya embrace you and immerse yourself in the mysticism of the Mustang.",
